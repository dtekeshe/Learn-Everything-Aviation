# Aircraft Documents

---

Operating an aircraft within the national airspace system requires a pilot to have certain documents onboard an aircraft at all times; this ensures aircraft are airworthy and safe to fly.

## Aircraft Owner/Information Manual

![Aircraft Owners Manual Example](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/owner_manual.png)

The aircraft owner/information manual is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains general information about the make and model of the aircraft. The manual is not approved by the (FAA) and is not specific to an individual aircraft. The manual provides general information about the operation of an aircraft, is not kept current, and cannot be substituted for the Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot Operating Handbook.



## Airplane Flight Manual

![Aircraft Flight Manual Examples](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/flight_manual.png)

An Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and approved by the FAA. This book contains the information and instructions required to operate an aircraft safely. A pilot must comply with this information which is specific to a particular make and model of aircraft, usually by serial number. An AFM contains the operating procedures and limitations of that aircraft.



## Pilot Operating Handbook

![Pilot Operating Handbook Examples](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/poh.png)

The POH is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains FAA-approved AFM information. If "POH" is used in the main title, a statement must be included on the title page indicating that sections of the document are FAA approved as the AFM. The POH for most light aircraft built after 1975 is also designated as the FAA-approved flight manual. The typical AFM/POH contains the following nine sections: General; Limitations; Emergency Procedures; Normal Procedures; Performance; Weight and Balance/Equipment List; Systems Description; Handling, Service, and Maintenance; and Supplements.



## Ramp Inspections

![FAA Ramp Inspection](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/faa_ramp_check.png)

The airworthiness of an aircraft is the responsibility of the pilot and monitored by airworthiness inspectors. Pilots are subject to ramp inspections at any time by an authorized FAA inspector. Ramp inspections are not planned for specific operators and usually occur if an inspector observes an unsafe operation in the traffic pattern/ramp, is notified by ATC of unsafe operations or is conducting normal surveillance. The FAA inspector will require that the pilots furnish the following documents listed below to show that the aircraft is airworthy. Many pilots find it helpful to remember the acronym ARROW as a memory aid for listing the required aircraft documents.

- **A** irworthiness Certificate
- **R** egistration Certificate
- **R** adio Station License (international flights only)
- **O** perating Limitations (POH)
- **W** eight and Balance Information

_Airworthiness Certificate_
A standard, restricted, limited, or experimental certificate accompanied by a list of limitations and conditions necessary for safe operation.

_Registration Certificate_
Aircraft registration that shows registered owner. Sometimes a temporary (pink slip) registration is issued if the registered owner changed. If so, pink slip is valid for 120 days.

_Radio Station License_
An aircraft Federal Communications Commission (FCC) radio license is required for international flights.

_Operating Limitations_
The aircraft's pilot operating handbook that lists any limitations.

_Weight and Balance Information_
Weight and balance documents, including a list of equipment, must be on board the aircraft.



### Tips

- The FAA does not regulate the requirement for a Radio Station License, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires this license for international flights.
- All aircraft registered in the United States has a registration/tail number starting with letter "N".



### Federal Aviation Regulations

- <span class="badge-warning font-w700 px-1">&#167; 91.9</span> An Aircraft Flight Manual is required to be on board the aircraft along with the appropriate markings and placards.
- <span class="badge-warning font-w700 px-1">&#167; 21.183</span> 	A restricted, limited, or experimental certificate must be accompanied by a list of limitations and conditions necessary for safe operations.
- <span class="badge-warning font-w700 px-1">&#167; 21.197</span> A Special Flight Permit is issued to aircraft that may not be airworthy but are capable of safe flight under certain conditions.
